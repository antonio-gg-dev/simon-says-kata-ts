# Simon Says Kata

Simon is a game of short-term memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.

## Rules
- The computer generates a random color (green, red, blue or yellow) [_and a tone linked to that color_]
- If the player presses the correct combination of colors, a new color will be appended at the end of the list
- If the player selects an incorrect color, then the game is over
- The game runs until the player loses

## Output

```txt
Welcome to the game!
Simon will show you a sequence of colors, repeat the sequence by entering the colors separated by a space.
The colors are: Red [R], Blue [B], Yellow [Y] and Green [G].

Simon says: yellow
Your turn: y
Good job!

Simon says: yellow green
Your turn: y g
Good job!

Simon says: yellow green blue
Your turn: y g r
Game over!
```
